*I would like to acknowledge that today we're meeting on lands belonging to the Kaurna people. We acknowledge the deep feelings of attachment and relationship of the Kaurna people to their Place.*

<br>
*We also pay respects to the cultural authority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from other areas of Australia, and pay our respects to Elders past, present and emerging.*

## Welcome

- Welcome to the 2025 ABACBS / BiocAsia Workshops 
- Wanted to give all presenters a good amount of time to demonstrate their material
    + Less of a sneak peak $\implies$ More of a deep dive
- Originally had enough applications to fill 11 consecutive days 
    + Presenters have been flexible & helpful managing this

:::
    
::: {.fragment}

- Today we have 5 parallel streams with many at room capacity
- Tomorrow $\implies$ 3 streams

## Workshops

- Preparing a workshop is a huge task $\implies$ presenters have worked incredibly hard
- Pawsey have generously provided VMs where required
    + Galaxy/Bioc *BuildABiocWorkshop* resource temporarily unavailable
- VMs will be allocated for each session <br>$\implies$ everything should just work &#129310;

::: {.fragment}

- Presenters have worked closely with Michael Roach to prepare images
- Images have been tested very carefully but...

## Knowing Where To Go


*Many people can't remember what they registered for*

::: {.column width='60%'}
- Every registration we have is on this page
- Some were registered by a colleague / supervisor
- Some didn't reallocate after cancellation
- Please talk to me **immediately** after

## Virtual Machines

- VMs are only available during the session
- Pawsey's allocation is generous but finite 
    + Thursday morning $\implies$ 98% VM capacity
- Don't keep notes on the VM, keep them locally
- New VMs & IPs will be allocated as sessions change
    + Please refresh https://blackochrelabs.au/abacbs2025_workshops/vm_allocation.html
    + We will update as new VMs are launched
