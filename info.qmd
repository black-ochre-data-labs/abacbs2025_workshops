# Location

Workshops will be held in Festival Tower located [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gwrbmTE6J4puUPum9).
Please note, it's a relatively new building so Google Maps hasn't updated street view to show the building yet.
The entrance is on the western side facing the Adelaide Casino (i.e. the old Railway Station).
**There are two entrances on the western side. Choose the one closest to the river**.
There will be greeters there on Thursday to help you find your way.

Once inside the building, head to room 605 for the key information session starting at 8:30am on Thursday 27th.
As we will be spread across multiple floors throughout the day, *level 5 has been designated as the location for catering.*
There will be coffee and tea-making facilities available there as well.

The full workshop program will remain [available here](index.html)

# Setup Instructions

Most workshops will use VMs, generously provided by [Pawsey](https://pawsey.org.au).
However, some will be designed to run on your local machines and have specific requirements.
