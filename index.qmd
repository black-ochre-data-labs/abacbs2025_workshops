The ABACBS25 Conference have joined with BiocAsia to organise two full days of workshops immediately following the main conference.
All workshops will be held in [Festival Tower](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gwrbmTE6J4puUPum9) overlooking the Festival Theatre and the River Torrens.

All are welcome, including those who have attended the ABACBS Conference and those who simply wish to attend some high-quality training workshops.
Registrations *are now open* on the main [ABACBS workshop website](https://www.abacbs.org/abacbs-2025-workshops)

Catering will be provided on both days in a common area

- 10:30-11:00am Morning Tea
- 12:30-1:30pm Lunch
- 3:00-3:30pm Afternoon Tea

Please find an outline of the currently scheduled sessions immediately below, along with a [browsable table](#full-table-with-abstracts) including all abstracts

      Deep learning for structural biology has numerous applications, ranging 
      from basic research through to clinical application. A key challenge with 
      these approaches is accessibility, and much work is currently being 
      conducted to develop computational workflows to improve this access. 
      However, building, executing, and sharing workflows is challenging. The 
      difficulty only increases when implementing novel approaches like deep 
      learning, and even more so when moving these workflows to national
      infrastructure to operate at scale. Some of the challenges include knowing 
      how to develop a workflow to optimise use of these large compute systems, 
      how to configure and deploy workflows that can efficiently employ both CPU 
      and GPU, and how to share the workflows created so that others can find,
      understand, reuse, and ultimately cite the workflow. This workshop will 
      examine these challenges from the perspective of a workflow’s life cycle, 
      and in doing so provide both theory and hands-on activities that will 
      support bioinformaticians to develop, execute, and share computational 
      workflows for structural biology at scale.

        is built upon the (Tree)SummarizedExperiment data container — the central data
        structure in Bioconductor — and provides a comprehensive suite of statistical
        tools for microbiome data science. It is continuously expanding with new methods
        and offers native support for multi-table and hierarchical data, while being
        computationally more efficient than previous approaches. These features enable

        During the workshop, participants will gain hands-on experience with the
        (Tree)SummarizedExperiment data container and the mia framework through a
        practical case study. The practicals cover common downstream analysis steps,
        from data import and wrangling to diversity estimation, differential abundance
        analysis, and visualization. After the workshop, participants will have the
        skills to continue learning through the freely available online book
        Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis with Bioconductor
        (https://microbiome.github.io/OMA), which promotes best practices and
